Pitch is fundamental to various facets of human hearing, including music appreciation, speech comprehension, vocal learning, and sound source differentiation. How does the brain encode the perceptual features of pitch? By applying machine learning techniques to time-resolved neuroimaging data of individuals listening to different pitches, our findings reveal that pitch height and chroma-two distinct features of pitch-are associated with different neural dynamics within the auditory-frontal cortical network, with height playing a more prominent role. This offers a unified theoretical framework for understanding the perceptual and neural characteristics of pitch perception and opens new avenues for noninvasively decoding human auditory perception to develop brain-computer interfaces.
