Auditory and speech signals are undisputedly processed in both left and right hemispheres, but this bilateral allocation is likely unequal. The Asymmetric Sampling in Time (AST) hypothesis proposed a division of labor that has its neuroanatomical basis in the distribution of neuronal ensembles with differing temporal integration constants: left auditory areas house a larger proportion of ensembles with shorter temporal integration windows (tens of milliseconds), suited to process rapidly changing signals; right auditory areas host a larger proportion with longer time constants (∼150–300 ms), ideal for slowly changing signals. Here we evaluate the large body of findings that clarifies this relationship between auditory temporal structure and functional lateralization. In this reappraisal, we unpack whether this relationship is influenced by stimulus type (speech/nonspeech), stimulus temporal extent (long/short), task engagement (high/low), or (imaging) modality (hemodynamic/electrophysiology/behavior). We find that the right hemisphere displays a clear preference for slowly changing signals whereas the left-hemispheric preference for rapidly changing signals is highly dependent on the experimental design. We consider neuroanatomical properties potentially linked to functional lateralization, contextualize the results in an evolutionary perspective, and highlight future directions.
