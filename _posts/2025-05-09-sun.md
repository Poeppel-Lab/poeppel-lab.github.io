Ample evidence demonstrates synchronized neurophysiological activity to the temporal regularities of sounds. This phenomenon has been proposed to reflect neural responses to onset edges in acoustic signals. Here, we examine listeners’ ability to behaviorally synchronize to stimuli with sharp or gradual onsets. In two experiments, we show that while the sharp amplitude onsets facilitate temporal phase alignment between participants’ behavioral output and the stimulus envelope, sharp onsets are not essential for tracking the rate of auditory rhythms in the acoustic input. The dissociation between phase and rate tracking suggests distinct underlying neural mechanisms that are separately modulated.
