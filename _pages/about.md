## From vibrations in the ear to abstractions in the brain

We pursue research that aims to be theoretically motivated, computationally explicit, and biologically realistic, focusing typically on auditory perception, speech perception, language comprehension, music processing.

The questions we study often extend across areas of inquiry, although not all of the work is necessarily interdisciplinary. The lab uses whatever tools fit the questions. This includes *electrophysiological recordings* using magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocorticography (ECoG), *electrophysiological data* from bats and monkeys, imaging approaches using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well the cognitive science, from psychophysics to psycholinguistics and modeling.
